# 🚀 QA Portfolio

Welcome to my **Portfolio**, a collection of hands-on testing projects demonstrating my technical skills, analytical thinking, and structured approach to software quality.

This repository acts as a hub, while **all project documentation is organized inside the GitHub Wiki**.  
Each project is presented as a realistic testing scenario with goals, tools, workflows, findings, and takeaways.

## 🙌 About This Portfolio

My goal is to demonstrate not only familiarity with QA theory, but **real hands-on testing experience**:
working with data, APIs, logs, environments, and documentation—similar to workflows in actual QA teams.

Thanks for visiting!
