# 📂 QA Project Portfolio: Deliverables and Artifacts

👋 **Welcome to my structured QA Portfolio!**

This repository serves as the central hub for showcasing my practical testing skills across various projects and technical domains. Unlike simple file dumps, this structure demonstrates my ability to manage complex test artifacts and documentation within a project-based environment.

---

### 🎯 Repository Goal

The main objective of this repository is to provide tangible evidence of my skills, spanning the entire QA lifecycle from test design to root cause analysis. Each folder within the repository represents a distinct project.

### 🧭 Navigation & Structure

Each project folder follows a consistent, two-part structure to ensure clarity and easy navigation for reviewers:

| Folder | Content Goal | Demonstrated Skills |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`1_Documentation`** | Contains test planning and reporting materials. | Test Case Design, Checklist Creation, Test Planning, Bug Reporting. |
| **`2_Backend_Validation`** | Contains technical files used for diagnostic and data integrity checks. | **API Testing** (Postman), **SQL** (DB Validation), **KQL** (Log Analysis). |
| **`3_CI_CD_Config`** | Contains environment setup files for integration and deployment. | **Docker** (Environment setup), **Jenkins** (Pipeline integration). |

### 🛠️ Key Technical Artifacts

The `2_Backend_Validation` folder contains real-world technical files that back up the documentation:

* **Postman Queries (.json):** Exported collections used for API regression and functional testing.
* **SQL Queries (.sql):** Queries used to verify data integrity and state changes in the database after API calls.
* **KQL/Log Queries (.txt):** Diagnostic queries written for Kibana to investigate logs.
